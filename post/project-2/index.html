    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>what is clash royale?</p>
<p>Clash Royale is a free-to-play real-time strategy video game developed and published by Supercell. The game combines elements from collectible card games, tower defense, and multiplayer online battle arena. The game was released globally on March 2, 2016.</p>
<p>Clash Royale is a tower rush video game which pits players in games featuring two or four players (1v1 or 2v2) in which the objective is to destroy the most opposing towers, with the destruction of the &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Tower&rdquo; being an instantaneous win.
After three minutes, if both of the players/teams have an equal number of crowns or none at all the match continues into a 2-minute overtime period and the player who destroys an opposing tower wins instantaneously.
If no towers are destroyed during overtime, there is a tiebreaker where all towers rapidly lose health, and the tower with the least health is destroyed.
If the two towers with the lowest health have the same health, there is a draw.
After an update in late 2018, leaving a 2v2 match multiple times prevents the player from playing 2v2 with random players for some time.
a player wins a battle by destroying more towers than the opponent (each destroyed tower being represented as a &lsquo;crown&rsquo;), or by destroying the opponent&rsquo;s King&rsquo;s Tower, resulting in an automatic &ldquo;three-crown&rdquo; victory, commonly described as being &ldquo;three-crowned&rdquo;. (unless the King&rsquo;s Tower was destroyed at the same time by both players, resulting in a draw, however this is nearly impossible).</p>
<p>problem statement why i did this project?
based on cards we&rsquo;re playing can we predict the outcome of battle?
who&rsquo;s gonna win/who&rsquo;s more likely to win?</p>
<p>how this is done?
steps -
1.data collection - royaleapi, statsroyale, deckshop pro and wikipedia</p>
<ul>
<li>top 5 players matches and all cards info from deckshop pro                              <br>
mapped together</li>
</ul>
<p>2.custom encoding - formula - elixir + power ranking (in terms of most wins and uses 6 being really good 1 being awful)Ã—16.66
formula = elixir + K* 16.66</p>
<p>3.target column - player 1 crowns - player 2 crowns = outcome columns 0 being loss and 1 being win (if +ve then win else lose)</p>
<p>4.alogithms applied - 1.logistic regression
2.random forest 3.svm</p>
<p>results : accuracy with logistic regression 64% accuracy with random forest 84% using svm its 64%</p>
<p>can this be really helpful in finding synergy between certain cards? helpful in finding card combinations to win more matches? training an ai to win against players possible? can ai learn the pattern to beat skilled players? helpful finding one&rsquo;s weakness against certain cards&hellip;. can find which matches were lost most on facing certain cards by specific player</p>
<p>drawbacks - 1.card levels - I assumed cards level to be equal(max)</p>
